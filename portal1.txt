hello on the subject of this audio sa is my absence the tech platforms the 2020 election Jean seberg and oddly enough article 58 of the former Soviet Union's Russian penal code I don't want to say too much quite yet about what I've been up to but suffice it to say that I'm fine or at least as fine as anyone is in 2020 also rest assured that I have not forgotten about you all or lost interest in the podcast or more importantly our community far from it in fact if the exact opposite of that I want to ensure that we can continue talking and building in the community that is spring up around the podcast portal Nation if you will is a place where I choose to spend my own free time with perhaps less distance than I should have with my audience as many of you have become my friends
some time ago I started warning many of my friends to be very careful on the internet in the immediate run up to the 2020 us election in particular I warned people associated with the intellectual dark web that they should be very careful not to lose their accounts in the time since we have seen new levels of bizarre behavior on Twitter and Facebook would seem to be catching up to Google in terms of naked attempt to manipulate the national conversation not all of the Sinister mind you I don't hate having actual facts checked by true fact Checkers although the words actual and true are doing a lot of heavy lifting in the sentence the idea for the warning was simple back in November of 2016 I started commenting on the idea that the quote fake news close quote Panic was not authentic but it was likely constructed in November of 2016 as a placeholder to be used by institutions stunned by the results and walked in their faith that they could broadly control every election to make sure that both candidates were broadly acceptable to the institutional class with no Ralph Nader is Ron Paul's Ross Perot's or Bernie Sanders to worry about
now that is an odd thing to say what does that mean in authentic or constructed many of you are no doubt thinking I remember everyone talking about fake news all during the election isn't that interesting because that is not what happened at all that's a fake memory and it's not even yours in fact as late as the end of October of 2016 almost no one was talking much about fake news in fact the concept didn't really Spike until after Trump's Victory it was not until the week of Sunday November 13th 2016 that the hypnotic and invariant phrase fake news exploded and went from being an extremely minor news story to the supposedly settled explanation for everything that had caught the New York Times the Democratic party and heavily anti-trump Tech Giants measuring the Oval Office drapes while about to lose the race of a lifetime
which is to say I wasn't buying it I just sat there and watched helplessly as everyone I knew responded to the perseverate add phrase being repeated into their minds interesting ly this was seemingly an exact repeat of the so-called Dean scream which occurred at 12 years earlier on Monday January 19th 2004 when the news media have destroyed the political campaign of Howard Dean over a total and complete non-event by perseveration alone to create fear uncertainty and down or fud is it is known to conspirators who practice this disinformation technique at that time the entire United States save for a few contrarians got brainwashed into seeing a candidate supposedly lose his mind on stage at which would never have occurred to anyone at the institutional media hadn't repeated it into his so-called alternative fact in the minds of Americans if you doubt me Dave Rubin and I arranged to have me on the show The Rubin report before Trump's inauguration so that there would be a permanent archival record of my claims and to which all folks would later question these claims could return
I further went to the trouble before the election of having my employer acquaint everyone in the firm with the theory of preference falsification due to Economist Timur Kuran one of our first guests because I was all but certain that the polling data and the Gated institution narrative had not accounted for people lying about their hidden support for Donald Trump and perhaps now you understand more about the title of the last portal episode has a mildly coded message to my treasured audience I once again suspected that almost everybody who is not sufficiently disagreeable to be considered Milgram negative Ash negative and zimbardo negative according to the three famous psychology experiments was about to go completely insane as we did four years ago it is simply too hard for ordinary people whose ability to feed their families depend on working for institutions to resist the drumbeat of either the Democratic or republican Master narratives
and most of you were my audience were born after 1980 and so you cannot obviously remember the revelations of the mid-1970s the way I do when I was around 10 years old but for me and others in Progressive American families the Revelation that the FBI had secretly planted totally false stories like the one that destroyed the reputation career and ultimately the sanity of law-abiding Progressive Hollywood star Jean seberg and mainstream newspapers and news magazines like the Los Angeles Times and news we cast a long Shadow the reason is simple we have all the chilling receipts at the kids say today the idea of the u.s. deep States use of mainstream media to destroy lawful citizens lives Insanity simply for political beliefs is not a conspiracy theory it is in fact a one-hundred-percent certain conspiracy fact that for some odd reason isn't taught much in US high schools it is also the reason that we must investigate the investigators and eavesdrop on our own spies if you wish to remain a
truly free Society well I am of the belief that destroying people is considered fair play in elections by the Insiders who view these contest is their own private Bloodsport 2 which ordinary dissenting Americans are viewed as Interlopers and the spray
 an increasingly very few of us outside or seem to believe in democracy anymore as we increasingly believe that our side must always win against the implacable foe by any means necessary to quote brother Malcolm
 when the sport of personal reputation of Destruction is coordinated by members of the complex formed by institutional media the intelligence Community the political parties political Consultants Finance heck in the Academy I call it see bergang to remind us of just how real the threat is to all who have idiosyncratic politics but you have done nothing legally wrong
 now as many of you might guess if I had a strong belief that I could do something to save us by telling you to vote Biden or vote for Trump I don't think I would let the stand in my way
 the truth be told I don't think we are playing the lady and the tiger with these two parties anymore it's more like the Bengal tiger versus the Siberian tiger so naturally I was trying to figure out any way to plausibly open both doors to try to get the two parties to focus on eating each other rather than the rest of us and I'm sorry to say that I along with absolutely everyone else I know have failed to come up with any plausible options we seem to be on autopilot we build institutions that are going to oversee our undoing unless someone figures out a way to stop playing with the failed septuagenarians in octogenarians who came in as young people to the National stage in the 1970s and every written in the rules for their own plunder in enrichment for 30 to 50 years this essay is a bit heavy right pause the audio pace yourself take a deep breath maybe think about puppies and continued so to sum up the above I don't believe almost any of what we were talking about on a daily basis makes any sense we are going to wind up with one of two candidates that should not be running for control of the nuclear missile launch codes
 4 years ago I called the 2016 election the Sophie's Choice election and I barely got myself to vote for Hillary Clinton who I could not stand this year I put the pain directly over by the name and could not get the pain to move towards the paper this was a bit of a surprise that never happened before where I could not vote for my own party was it true that I become a trump supporter I tried the same Ouija board maneuver and this time I couldn't even get the pain to hover over Trump's name so what was happening I won't bore you with who I voted for because it doesn't matter I'm only telling you this because I failed this basic test and threw my vote to someone who will not win and with that I will promise you that I will not judge you for your vote you cannot do worse than I did so I have no way to blame you for whichever way you choose to fail this is not the Sophie's Choice election this was actually supposed to be the King Solomon election in my mind where if either candidate truly love the country more you would have been the first to resign so getting back to my absence I became convinced that the portal was a very little value to you
 in the election process a mini of you flattered me by saying where are you when we need you most is if I had somehow abandon you and I am touched but that is not where we are I don't have your answers and I'm lost as well so I have been trying to look past the election for months I'm just being honest you
 whatever we are going to do to save ourselves from the kleptocrats at the center the nutjobs of the far-right the apathy of the non-voters the woke lunacy and the dreamers of third-party options we are going to do with either Trump or biting in office for years ago before Trump took the oath of office I was at a dinner in Los Angeles with Sam Harris and Dave Rubin Sam was talking about how he was going to have to hold Trump accountable with his broadcast I said something that I'd like to think turned out to be wise Sam you just can't do that I said he asked why I would say that came in my feelings which were not out of line with his I said I studied Trump style and it's based around deliberate ambiguities that left and right can be counted upon to hear as meaning different thing if Trump makes in nested ambiguous statements in a minute you will create a minimum of two to the end legs of the decision tree that must be considered giving your strategy he will dusk be able to force you and the rest of the unsuspecting United States public intellectuals to waste much of your info actual life for 4 to 8 years picking up
 after him he just needs to knock over the intellectual boz's faster than you can glue the shards back together and no matter how good you are you aren't going to make it through like that so what will you do instead he asked I said I will make one or more clear statement that Donald Trump represent an existential risk to the fabric of the United States and that I expect he will use his freedom as an outsider to do a combination of both very good and very bad things but I'm not going to let him run my intellectual life every day on his truly ingenious brainfarts I will then Focus my energy and attempt to hold my own party the Democrats intellectual accountable so that we can win with someone we can believe it and except for that part at the tail-end I think I did about as well as I could have been anticipating the problems and formulating a strategy during these for years so why be absent well I haven't gotten to the part about article 58 yet
 recall that I don't believe that fake news was an authentic narrative in November 2016 so what was it then well I don't know but if I had to guess I would say that there was probably a meeting somewhere around early November of 2016 where was decided that the United States needed a narrative to buy time for its aggrieved institutions so that the 2020 election could be fixed to the greatest extent possible and I believe it fake news was likely the placeholder that has been settled upon that would be the origin of the gradual changes in terms of service across Twitter Facebook and Google and how the structural changes were coordinated that would gradually a road all protections for free speech across the platforms that's where data and society and it's crazy guilt-by-association - any methodology technique appeared in essence the 4-year battle plan was to figure out how to use the fake news meme to gain greater narrative control of the news only there was a new problem
 we the people had become enmeshed in the news we shared stories in length and to control the news now meant the institutions had to control us as Ordinary People much more aggressively we all opined often and often better than the professional commentary it at that and long-form podcasting is led by the popular Joe Rogan became seen as the great embarrassment in threat to mainstream Legacy Media people dying to be treated like adults with long attention spans dropped in PR in the New York Times is home to the 1619 project which is leader openly admitted with attempted to get America the riot and flocked to podcast hours in length to listen to Snowden or Bernie Sanders on Joe Rogan and there was no plan to stop this that was working when they finally realize just how powerful these podcasts are you can hear Rodger Penrose 1 minute and Eddie Bravo the next everyone knew that simply calling Sam Harris gross and racist and Joe Rogan alt right Ben Shapiro a Nazi white supremacist Peter teal anti-gay Bret Weinstein and he black
 maajid Nawaz an islamophobe was beyond stupid I mean our audiences had spent hours listening to us and interacting with us at events it wasn't just that the mainstream media was bullshiting the American public they would gas-lighting us all around people that we already knew and failing so long as they were people willing to risk their reputation to shatter that evil spell so they figured out that we needed the Platforms in part to reach each other and proceeded to change the platform rules over and over again to make them vague illogical ideological inconsistent and actually impossible to understand add to that these platforms were now controlled by a new religious beliefs if you will as if Twitter were Saudi Arabia and the committee for the promotion of virtue and the prevention of Vice was replaced by the trust and Safety Committee no one could say what the rules were what exactly was deadnaming for example you saying that Bruce Jenner won the 1976 decathlon years before Caitlyn Jenner even existed a punishable offense only the trust and Safety Committee could tell you
 which brings us to article 58 of the Soviet era Russian Penal Code which introduced the concept of anomie of the workers and counter-revolutionary activities as the major crime you see article 58 was a law everyone was guilty but not everyone was prosecuted that's any inconvenient person could be disappeared into the gulags OR executed in show trials under article 58 and that is where we are shortly before the election a provocative mid-october New York Post article on Hunter Biden appeared that could not be shared on Twitter or Facebook which is of course insane but also anticipated here's why they failed to come up with a workable strategy to control us because there is really nothing they can do short of totally Draconian China like measures and so they will ultimately lose this battle one day that Jake has been up for years now but the Legacy intek powers do not know how to concede so The Gaslight they harass and they threaten individual the don't agree to silent themselves and sure enough just like with article 58 in the show trials detect
 Warren Street trust and safety as a Star Chamber where you can be accused without being told what you did wrong and tried In Absentia help we are all guilty of violating these terms of service because they aren't wheel well defined or even self-consistent which brings me to what I said to my brother Brett not long ago when he proposed Unity 2020 is a plan to undermine the control of the two-party duopoly by drafting a Republican and a Democrat to run together I told him it couldn't work unless extraordinary piece of luck occurred and it was a bad use of political Capital to call everything dangerous like the selection make or break the other thing I said was that Unity 2024 is it good idea but then you should do this project in a separate account on Twitter and Facebook did not listen it first and released video on his own YouTube channel very quickly the articles of unity account they'd set up on Twitter was suspended without explanation links to Unity 20/20 website shared through direct messaging where labeled suspicious and spam by Twitter's religious beliefs it appeared that the thought of them
 Americans coming together and burying their hatchets was seen as a serious offense which they usually forward-thinking CEO Jack Dorsey himself could not face for reasons that remain utterly opaque a short time later Brett login to Facebook to find his personal account in which you not posted for some time had been irreversibly closed reviewed and that there were no appeals possible while stating no reason for the expulsion after a public outcry from Joe Lonsdale Tulsi gabbard myself and others and some back-channel communication to Facebook board members the account was mysteriously opened again with a claim that it had merely been flagged by a system
 really whatever Facebook was doing it was willing to lie about this in front of the eyes of the world right before an election either it was reviewed in the claim about him your system flag in the account was fake news or there was no review a claim of human review is fake news in either case Facebook just like the New York Times Twitter CNN and all the other supposedly authoritative media have been pushing the very fake news that they claimed to cry there are now no other possibilities for those of us who've been watching the space that their scrutiny given the inconsistency of the claims and so I took the time off so as not to give too much surface area to Mark Zuckerberg Jack Dorsey and Sundar pichai and whomever they are coordinating with or delegating to in the two to three months before the election in a couple of months thereafter is what the financial professionals call the uncompensated risk of losing my ability to communicate with you while the tech and media worlds are going for broke to control this election if I knew that there was a good choice for you to make in the election the risk would have a purpose but I can see the unraveling of the night
 States fabric with either Choice it made me sad to pull back from something I love doing and it's a real cost to me is it significant income to miss out on it is time that I want to be building for retirement presumably sometime in my eighties the way I'm going but truth be told there are also some other more minor issues I was having with Coca-Cola and guests in the studio loss of privacy and some sad interactions with unstable people in my communities who seem to need psychological help I may or may not choose to say something about these issues later but I miss doing the portal for you all and I will be back in 2021 with perhaps a few episodes before then but in the meantime remember that one of the portal is to only go long heroism if you can short martyrdom is part of the trade I didn't enjoy us having to get bread reinstated Facebook as no ordinary person without connections are followers we get this treatment and we still haven't succeeded in getting Jack to explain what is going on at Twitter with the suspensions so stay safe out there you don't have to swing for the fences on this election because quite frankly both of these are terrible options. However you feel is
 because if I'm right the real work is going to come after this the most bogus of us elections that I've ever witnessed be well everyone
